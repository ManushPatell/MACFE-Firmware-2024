Introduction

This repository contains a simple C++ program that prints "Hello World" to the console.
Requirements

To compile and run the C++ program, you need the following:

    A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
    A terminal or command line interface

Alternatively, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like:

    Code::Blocks
    Visual Studio
    CLion

Instructions for Compiling and Running (C++)
Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, you can do so by running:

bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MACFE-Firmware-2024.git
cd MACFE-Firmware-2024

Step 2: Compile the Program

If you're using the terminal, navigate to the directory where the main.cpp file is located, then run the following command to compile the program:

bash

g++ main.cpp -o hello_world

This will create an executable file called hello_world.
Step 3: Run the Program

To run the compiled program, use the following command in the terminal:

bash

./hello_world

You should see the output:

bash

Hello World

Step 4: Using an IDE (Optional)

If you prefer to use an IDE, open the project folder in your IDE and run the program directly. The IDE will handle the compilation and execution for you.
